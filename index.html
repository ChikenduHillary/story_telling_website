              submission as plagiarism, and Samantha lost her scholarship.
              Worse, her name spread through the academic community, leaving her
              blacklisted from graduate programs.

              During a crucial exam, David noticed a group of students passing

              told the professor. The cheating students were caught, but they

              though he did the right thing, David became an outcast among his
              peers. His integrity cost him friendships, and he began to
              question whether reporting the misconduct was worth the price.

              thesis to another professor. Feeling betrayed, James confronted
              him, but Alex denied everything. They were both called into the
              dean's office for an investigation, and while Alex was expelled,
              James's reputation was forever stained by the ordeal.

              material from previously published work. When the plagiarized
              material was discovered, Dr. Lewis was forced to retire early.
              Andrew, on the other hand, faced expulsion and legal action for
