      <p class="title">The Garrison Scandal</p>
      <p>
        The mathematics department was rocked by a cheating scandal when several
        students were caught using a sophisticated cheating ring. The ring,
        which was led by a group of senior students, used advanced technology to
        transmit answers to students during exams.<br /><br />

        The scandal led to a massive investigation, and several students were
        expelled or suspended. The department was forced to re-examine its exam
        policies and implement stricter measures to prevent cheating.<br /><br />

        The scandal also led to a wider conversation about the pressures of
        academic life and the temptations of cheating. Students and faculty
        alike were forced to confront the reality of cheating and its
        consequences.<br /><br />

        As the investigation unfolded, it became clear that the cheating ring
        had been operating for months, and dozens of students had been involved.
        The department was shocked and outraged by the extent of the cheating,
        and many students felt betrayed by their peers.<br /><br />

        The scandal had serious consequences for the students involved. Many of
        them were expelled or suspended, and others were forced to retake exams
        or complete additional coursework. The department also implemented new
        policies to prevent cheating, including more frequent exams and stricter
        proctoring.<br /><br />

        In the end, the scandal served as a wake-up call for the department and
        the students. It highlighted the importance of academic integrity and
        the consequences of cheating. The department emerged from the scandal
        with a renewed commitment to fairness and honesty, and the students
        learned a valuable lesson about the importance of hard work and
        integrity.
