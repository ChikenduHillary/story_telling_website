      <p class="title">Chizoba's Phone Mishap</p>
      <p>
        Chizoba was a bright and ambitious undergraduate student studying
        mathematics. She had always excelled in the subject, and her lecturer,
        Professor Ezeh, had praised her for her exceptional problem-solving
        skills.<br /><br />

        But during her final exams, Chizoba found herself struggling to recall a
        crucial formula. She had studied hard for the exam, but her mind was a
        blank. Panicked, she decided to sneak a peek at her phone, which she had
        hidden under her desk.<br /><br />

        Chizoba knew it was wrong to use her phone during the exam, but she felt
        like she had no other choice. She quickly scrolled through her notes,
        hoping to find the formula she needed. But as she was scrolling, she
        accidentally clicked on a message from her friend, which made a loud
        beep.<br /><br />

        The invigilator, Mrs. Okafor, heard the beep and immediately walked over
        to Chizoba's desk. "What's going on here?" she asked, her eyes
        narrowing.<br /><br />

        Chizoba was caught off guard. She stuttered and stammered, trying to
        come up with an excuse. But Mrs. Okafor was having none of it.<br /><br />

        "You're cheating, Chizoba," she said, her voice firm. "I'm afraid you're
        going to have to leave the exam hall."<br /><br />

        Chizoba was mortified. She had never cheated before, and she couldn't
        believe she had been caught. She slowly gathered her things and left the
        exam hall, feeling like she was walking into a nightmare.<br /><br />

        The consequences of Chizoba's actions were severe. She was given a zero
        on the exam, and her lecturer, Professor Ezeh, was disappointed in her.
        Chizoba was devastated. She had let herself down, and she was ashamed of
        what she had done.<br /><br />

        But Chizoba learned a valuable lesson from her mistake. She realized
        that cheating was not worth the risk and that she should have worked
        harder to achieve her goals. She vowed never to cheat again and to
        always uphold academic integrity.
