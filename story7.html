      <p class="title">Emeka's Suspension</p>
      <p>
        Emeka was a third-year undergraduate student studying mathematics. He
        had always struggled with the subject, despite his best efforts. His
        lecturer, Professor Agu, was notorious for being strict and demanding,
        and Emeka felt like he was under a lot of pressure to perform well.<br /><br />

        As the final exams approached, Emeka felt the pressure mounting. He knew
        that if he didn't pass his mathematics exam, he would fail the entire
        course. He had tried everything to improve his grades - attending extra
        classes, hiring a tutor, even joining a study group - but nothing seemed
        to be working.<br /><br />

        Desperate to pass, Emeka made a decision that would change everything.
        He decided to cheat during the exam. He carefully hid his notes and
        formulas in his pocket, hoping to sneak a peek during the exam. He knew
        it was wrong, but he felt like he had no other choice.<br /><br />

        The day of the exam arrived, and Emeka was nervous. He took his seat in
        the exam hall, trying to calm his racing heart. As the exam began, Emeka
        tried to focus on the questions, but his mind kept wandering back to his
        notes. He knew he had to be careful - Professor Agu was known to be
        vigilant during exams.<br /><br />

        But Emeka's nerves got the better of him. As he was answering a
        question, he quickly glanced at his notes, hoping to get a glimpse of
        the formula he needed. But Professor Agu saw him. He walked over to
        Emeka's desk, his eyes blazing with anger.<br /><br />

        "Emeka, what do you think you're doing?" he thundered.<br /><br />

        Emeka was caught off guard. He stuttered and stammered, trying to come
        up with an excuse. But Professor Agu was having none of it.<br /><br />

        "You're cheating, Emeka," he said, his voice firm. "I'm afraid you're
        going to have to leave the exam hall."<br /><br />

        Emeka was devastated. He knew he had let himself down, and he was
        ashamed of what he had done. He slowly gathered his things and left the
        exam hall, feeling like he was walking into a nightmare.<br /><br />

        The consequences of Emeka's actions were severe. He was suspended from
        school for a semester, and his parents were called in for a meeting.
        Emeka was mortified. He had never been in trouble before, and he didn't
        know how to face his parents.<br /><br />

        The suspension was a wake-up call for Emeka. He realized that cheating
        had not only ruined his academic reputation but also damaged his
        relationships with his loved ones. He vowed never to cheat again and to
        work harder to achieve his goals.<br /><br />
